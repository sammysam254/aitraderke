# CRITICAL UPDATES APPLIED ✓

## Three Major Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ STAKE REDUCED TO $10 (was $15)

**Changed in:**
- Manual trades: Default stake = $10
- Auto-trading: Fixed stake = $10 per trade
- HTML input: Default value = $10

**Impact:**
- Smaller position sizes
- Less risk per trade
- More trades possible with same balance
- Better for small accounts

**Example:**
```
Before: $15 stake → 0.05-0.10 lots
After:  $10 stake → 0.03-0.07 lots
```

### 2. ✅ AUTO-CLOSE LOGIC FIXED

**NEW RULES:**

**Rule 1: Close if IN PROFIT (any amount)**
- If signal reverses → Close and take profit
- If momentum slows and profit > $2 → Close and take profit
- Examples:
  - BUY position with $3 profit + SELL signal appears → CLOSE
  - SELL position with $1 profit + momentum slowing → CLOSE

**Rule 2: Close if LOSS > $10**
- Only close losing trades when loss exceeds $10
- Let small losses ride (they might recover)
- Example:
  - Position at -$5 loss → KEEP OPEN (might recover)
  - Position at -$11 loss → CLOSE (stop loss triggered)

**Rule 3: Close if loss approaching $10 AND strong reversal**
- If loss > $7 AND signal strongly reversed → Close
- Prevents losses from reaching $10
- Example:
  - BUY at -$8 loss + strong SELL signal → CLOSE
  - SELL at -$6 loss + weak BUY signal → KEEP OPEN

**OLD LOGIC (REMOVED):**
- ❌ Closed trades with small losses ($3-$5)
- ❌ Closed profitable trades too early
- ❌ Didn't let winners run

**NEW LOGIC (BETTER):**
- ✅ Let winners run until signal reverses
- ✅ Let small losses recover
- ✅ Only cut losses when they're significant ($10+)

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the system:**
   ```cmd
   .\RUN_ADVANCED.bat
   ```

2. **Test with demo account first**
   - Verify $10 stake is working
   - Watch auto-close behavior
   - Monitor for 10-20 trades

3. **Check execution logs**
   - Look for detailed order info
   - Verify no execution errors
   - Confirm positions open correctly

4. **Monitor auto-close**
   - Profitable trades should close when signal reverses
   - Small losses should stay open
   - Large losses ($10+) should close immediately

The system is now safer, more conservative, and better at managing risk!
