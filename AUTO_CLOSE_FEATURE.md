# 🤖 Intelligent Auto-Close Feature

## Overview

The AI now **automatically monitors and closes positions** when the trading opportunity weakens or reverses. This protects your profits and cuts losses intelligently.

---

## How It Works

### Continuous Monitoring
- Checks every **10 seconds**
- Analyzes current market conditions
- Compares with position direction
- Makes intelligent close decisions

### Auto-Close Triggers

#### 1. **Signal Reversal** (Highest Priority)
- **BUY position** → AI detects SELL signal → **AUTO-CLOSE**
- **SELL position** → AI detects BUY signal → **AUTO-CLOSE**

Example:
```
Position: BUY EURUSD
Current Signal: SELL (reversed)
Action: AUTO-CLOSE immediately
Reason: "Signal reversed to SELL"
```

#### 2. **Opportunity Strength Weakening**
- Buy score drops below 3 AND sell score becomes stronger
- Sell score drops below 3 AND buy score becomes stronger

Example:
```
Position: BUY EURUSD
Buy Score: 2.5 (was 8.0)
Sell Score: 5.0
Action: AUTO-CLOSE
Reason: "Buy strength weakening"
```

#### 3. **AI Prediction Reversal**
- ML model predicts opposite direction with 60%+ confidence

Example:
```
Position: SELL GBPUSD
AI Prediction: BUY (confidence 75%)
Action: AUTO-CLOSE
Reason: "AI predicts reversal"
```

#### 4. **Take Profit on Momentum Slowdown**
- Position has $5+ profit
- Price momentum slowing down (< 30% of ATR)

Example:
```
Position: BUY USDJPY
Profit: $8.50
Momentum: Slowing
Action: AUTO-CLOSE
Reason: "Taking profit $8.50 - momentum slowing"
```

#### 5. **Cut Losses on Strong Reversal**
- Position has $3+ loss
- Opposite signal strength increased by 3+ points

Example:
```
Position: BUY AUDUSD
Loss: -$4.20
Sell Score: 7.5 (was 2.0)
Action: AUTO-CLOSE
Reason: "Cutting loss - strong reversal"
```
