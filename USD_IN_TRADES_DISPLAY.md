# USD IN TRADES DISPLAY ADDED ✓

## What Was Added

The interface now shows the total USD being used/risked across all open positions.

## New Display Elements

### Account Panel (Left Side):
```
Balance: $10,000.00
Equity: $10,050.00
Profit/Loss: $50.00
─────────────────────
💰 USD in Trades: $3,000.00
3 positions
```

### Position Cards:
Each position now shows:
- **Volume** - Number of lots (e.g., "0.05 lots")
- Entry price
- Current price
- Stop Loss & Take Profit
- P&L with $ sign

## How It Calculates USD Used

The system estimates margin requirements based on:

**Forex Pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, etc.):**
- 1 lot = $100,000 contract
- With 1:100 leverage = $1,000 margin per lot
- 0.05 lots = $50 margin

**JPY Pairs (USD/JPY, EUR/JPY, etc.):**
- Slightly less margin = $800 per lot
- 0.05 lots = $40 margin

**GOLD (XAU/USD):**
- Higher margin = $2,000 per lot
- 0.05 lots = $100 margin

**Example:**
```
Position 1: EURUSD 0.05 lots = $50
Position 2: GBPUSD 0.03 lots = $30
Position 3: XAUUSD 0.02 lots = $40
─────────────────────────────────
Total USD in Trades: $120
```

## Why This Matters

**Risk Management:**
- See how much capital is tied up in trades
- Avoid over-leveraging your account
- Know your exposure at a glance

**Position Sizing:**
- If you have $1,000 balance
- And $300 in trades (30% exposure)
- You have $700 available for new trades

**Safety Limits:**
- Recommended: Keep USD in trades < 30% of balance
- Conservative: < 20% of balance
- Aggressive: < 50% of balance

## Real-Time Updates

The display updates every 3 seconds automatically:
- Shows current number of positions
- Calculates total margin used
- Updates as positions open/close
