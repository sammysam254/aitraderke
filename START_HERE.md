## 🔄 To Use Real MT5 Data

The MetaTrader5 package requires Python 3.8-3.11 (not 3.14).

### Quick Fix:
1. Install Python 3.11 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Create virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   py -3.11 -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run with MT5:
   ```powershell
   python app.py
   ```

See **PYTHON_VERSION_FIX.md** for detailed instructions.
