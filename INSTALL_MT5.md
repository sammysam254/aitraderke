### Step 2: Download & Install MT5

1. Go to your chosen broker's website
2. Click "Download MT5" or "Open Demo Account"
3. Download the MT5 installer
4. Run the installer (it will install to `C:\Program Files\MetaTrader 5\`)
5. Complete the installation

### Step 3: Open a Demo Account

1. Launch MetaTrader 5
2. It will prompt you to open an account
3. Choose **"Open a demo account"**

8. Click **"Next"** and **"Finish"**

### Step 4: Get Your Credentials

After creating the demo account:

1. In MT5, go to **Tools → Options** (or press Ctrl+O)
2. Click the **"Server"** tab
3. Note down:
   - **Login**: Your account number (e.g., 12345678)
   - **Server**: Server name (e.g., "ICMarkets-Demo")
4. Your **Password**: The one you just created

### Step 5: Test Connection

Run this to verify MT5 is installed:

```cmd
.\venv311\Scripts\python.exe test_mt5_quick.py
```

If it says "✓ MT5 initialized successfully", you're good!

### Step 6: Start the Web App

START_TRADING.bat
```

Then open: http://localhost:5000

Click "Connect MT5" and enter your credentials!

## Alternative: Use Demo Mode (No MT5 Required)

If you don't want to install MT5 right now, you can use the demo version:

```cmd
.\venv311\Scripts\python.exe app_demo.py
```

This uses sample data instead of real MT5 data, but all features work!
